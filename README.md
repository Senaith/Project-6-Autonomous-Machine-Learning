# Project-6-Autonomous-Machine-Learning
## Autonomous machine learning based detection and identification of root cause for incidents in microservices running on EKS

In this project, I will demonstrate an alternative approach that uses the [Zebrium](https://www.zebrium.com/) machine learning (ML) platform to automatically find root cause in logs generated by an application deployed in [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## What is Machine Learning?

![ml2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91766546/160332972-e3a7ac47-15aa-46b4-8841-08f5081b8eef.jpg)

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems. Machine learning uses algorithms to identify patterns within data, and those patterns are then used to create a data model that can make predictions. With increased data and experience, the results of machine learning are more accurate—much like how humans improve with more practice.

The adaptability of machine learning makes it a great choice in scenarios where the data is always changing, the nature of the request or task are always shifting, or coding a solution would be effectively impossible.

## How does machine learning work?

Machine learning is comprised of different types of machine learning models, using various algorithmic techniques. Depending upon the nature of the data and the desired outcome, one of four learning models can be used: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement. Within each of those models, one or more algorithmic techniques may be applied – relative to the data sets in use and the intended results. Machine learning algorithms are basically designed to classify things, find patterns, predict outcomes, and make informed decisions. Algorithms can be used one at a time or combined to achieve the best possible accuracy when complex and more unpredictable data is involved. 

This project will cover:

- Installing the [Sock Shop](https://microservices-demo.github.io/) microservices demo app in an EKS cluster

- Installing Zebrium log collector
- Breaking the demo app (using a chaos engineering tool) and verifying that the Zebrium platform automatically finds the root cause.

### Prerequisites

1. An active AWS account.
2. AWS CLI with the IAM user having admin permission or having all the permissions to execute the setup.

4. A free [Zebrium](http://www.zebrium.com/sign-up) trial account.

Step 1
Create and configure an EKS cluster

The first step is launching a cluster which can be done using eksctl or through the Amazon console. For this cluster, we will use the console but since you still need eksctl that also needs to be installed.

To install eksctl:
